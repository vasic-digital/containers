// accel.go — per-OS hardware-acceleration model for the Android
// emulator runner.
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// containerized.go's Boot() hardcodes `--device /dev/kvm` in the
// `podman run` arguments. `/dev/kvm` is the Linux KVM (Kernel-based
// Virtual Machine) device interface. It is a fact, not a guess, that:
//
//   - Linux x86_64 hosts expose `/dev/kvm`; a Linux container can be
//     granted access to it via `--device /dev/kvm`, so the
//     Containerized runner is the OS-correct accelerated path on
//     Linux.
//   - macOS hosts have no `/dev/kvm`. macOS hardware acceleration is
//     Apple HVF (Hypervisor.framework), a macOS-host-only API. A
//     Linux container running under podman/docker on macOS executes
//     inside a Linux VM and cannot reach the host's HVF interface.
//     The Android emulator uses HVF automatically when launched as a
//     native macOS process — which is exactly what AndroidEmulator
//     (the host-direct runner in android.go) does. Therefore on macOS
//     the host-direct runner is the only accelerated path AND the
//     gate-eligible runner.
//   - Windows hosts have no `/dev/kvm`. Windows hardware acceleration
//     is WHPX (Windows Hypervisor Platform), a Windows-host-only API,
//     unreachable from a Linux container for the same reason as HVF.
//     The host-direct runner is the OS-correct path on Windows.
//
// This file makes that OS→accel→runner mapping an explicit, pure,
// deterministic function so callers (cmd/emulator-matrix, Lava's
// run-challenge-matrix.sh) can resolve the correct runner instead of
// hardcoding one. It does NOT change containerized.go: Linux still
// uses the existing `--device /dev/kvm` path verbatim.

// AccelBackend identifies a host's hardware-virtualization backend
// for the Android emulator. The Android emulator selects the backend
// from the host OS automatically; this type makes the host's backend
// explicit so the runner choice can be derived from it.
type AccelBackend string

	// container path can be guaranteed.

// RunnerKind identifies which emulator runner implementation is the
// OS-correct choice for a given host.
type RunnerKind string

const (
	// RunnerContainerized selects the Containerized runner
	// (containerized.go): the emulator process runs inside a
	// podman/docker container with `--device /dev/kvm`. This is the

	// by a native host process, not by a Linux container.
	RunnerHostDirect RunnerKind = "host-direct"

// OSAccelProfile records, for one host OS, which acceleration backend
// the Android emulator uses and which runner is therefore the

// it.

//   - "darwin"  → Accel HVF,  Runner host-direct. macOS has no
//     `/dev/kvm`; its HVF backend is a macOS-host-only API a Linux
//     container cannot reach. A native macOS emulator process uses
//     HVF automatically, so host-direct is the only accelerated path.
//   - "windows" → Accel WHPX, Runner host-direct. Windows has no
//     `/dev/kvm`; its WHPX backend is a Windows-host-only API a Linux
//     container cannot reach. A native Windows emulator process uses
//     WHPX automatically, so host-direct is the only accelerated path.
