# Container Resource Limits — Policy & Reference

> **One-line summary:** every container started under HelixAgent gets a
> hard memory cap, a swap cap equal to the memory cap, a pids cap, and a
> positive `oom_score_adj` so the container is the preferred OOM-killer
> victim — never the user's GUI session.

This document is the single source of truth for *why* the policy exists,
*how* it is enforced at three independent layers, and *how* to tune it
when adding a new container or stack.

---

## 1. The problem this policy solves

On the dev workstation that hosts the HelixAgent stack, the user GUI
session has been observed to be torn down with
`user@1000.service: Main process exited, code=killed, status=9/KILL`
multiple times per day during heavy work sessions (Kimi CLI + Claude Code
+ Podman compose stacks for Boba/MeTube + HelixAgent stacks).

Forensics from `journalctl`:

| Date / Time | user-1000.slice memory peak | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-23 22:03 | 47.4 GiB | Clean stop |
| 2026-04-25 02:46 | **60.4 GiB** + 7.7 GiB swap | SIGKILL of user manager |
| 2026-04-25 13:37 | **60.5 GiB** + 4 GiB swap | SIGKILL of user manager |

Box has 62 GiB RAM and 16 GiB swap. Without per-container limits, a
runaway image build, a leaking MCP server, or a perfectly normal stack
that just happens to overlap with three Claude Code sessions is enough
to push the user slice past 60 GiB. Once that happens:

* btrfs + heavy paging stalls system threads.
* GDM/Wayland watchdog cannot reach gnome-shell within timeout.
* `systemd` SIGKILL's the user manager because its `TimeoutStopSec`
  expires while it itself is paging.
* User is dropped at the GDM greeter, all running tools die.

**Important:** the kernel OOM killer never fires — there are no
`Out of memory: killed process …` lines in `journalctl -k`. So we cannot
rely on the kernel to clean up. The policy below is what makes Linux do
the right thing.

---

## 2. Defense in depth

Three layers, each independently sufficient to contain a runaway:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3 — system-side oomd / cgroup parent limits (NOT used     │
│           on this host because we do not have sudo here)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 2 — the `with-mem-cap` / `compose-up` user wrappers       │
│           in ~/.local/bin/. Run any heavy command inside a      │
│           transient `systemd-run --user --scope` with a hard    │
│           cap. If a container blows past Layer 1, Layer 2       │
│           catches it. Default 16G for `compose-up`.             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1 — per-container caps in every compose file:             │
│           mem_limit, memswap_limit, pids_limit, oom_score_adj   │
│           Enforced by the kernel via cgroup v2 memory.max,      │
│           memory.swap.max, pids.max. THIS DOC describes Layer 1.│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When all three layers are in place a memory leak in a single MCP server
still kills only that MCP server, not the user session.

---

## 3. The four cap fields

Every service in every user-owned compose file has exactly these four
top-level keys (Podman Compose / Docker Compose v2 schema):

| Key | Type | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `mem_limit` | size string (`512m`, `2g`) | Hard cgroup `memory.max`. Kernel kills processes inside the cgroup that try to exceed it. |
| `memswap_limit` | size string ≥ `mem_limit` | `memory.swap.max`. We **set it equal to `mem_limit`** so the container cannot smuggle the leak into swap. Setting it higher just delays the eventual SIGKILL while thrashing the disk. |
| `pids_limit` | int (≥ 128) | `pids.max`. Stops fork bombs and runaway thread pools from filling the pid space. |
| `oom_score_adj` | int 100–1000 | The Linux `oom_score_adj` for processes inside. Positive values mean "kill me first." We use `500` everywhere so kernel/oomd always picks a container over the user manager (which has `OOMScoreAdjust=-900`). |

> **Why not `deploy.resources.limits`?** That key only takes effect
> under Docker Swarm. Podman Compose ignores it. The top-level form
> above works on both Docker (non-Swarm) and Podman, which is what we
> actually run.

---

## 4. The policy itself

The cap for a service is chosen by **first-match-wins glob matching
against the lowercased service name**. The full table lives in two
synchronized places:

* `Containers/scripts/resource-policy/policy.yaml` — used by the bulk
  cap-applier (`apply_caps.py`).
* `Containers/pkg/policy/policy.go::Default()` — used at runtime by Go
  callers that want to apply the same caps when starting a container
  programmatically.

### 4.1 Selected cap tiers (full list in source)

| Service category | Pattern | mem | memswap | pids | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LLM inference | `ollama*`, `*triton*`, `vllm*` | 12g | 12g | 2048 | Model weights stay resident in RAM. |
| Browser MCP | `mcp-puppeteer*`, `mcp-playwright*`, `mcp-browserbase*` | 3g | 3g | 4096 | Headless Chromium needs many threads + RAM. |
| Image / ML MCP | `mcp-stable-diffusion*`, `mcp-imagesorcery*` | 3–4g | same | 1024 | ML inference + image buffers. |
| Generic MCP | `mcp-*` | 1g | 1g | 1024 | Most are thin Node/Python wrappers. |
| SonarQube | `sonarqube*` | 8g | 8g | 2048 | Java + ES embedded. |
| Search | `elasticsearch*`, `opensearch*` | 6g | 6g | 2048 | JVM heap + overhead. |
| Vector DBs | `qdrant*`, `weaviate*`, `chroma*` | 3–6g | same | 1024 | Index in RAM. |
| SQL DBs | `postgres*`, `mysql*`, `mongodb*` | 4g | 4g | 1024 | Buffer pools. |
| Caches | `redis*`, `memcached*`, `valkey*` | 1g | 1g | 1024 | Bounded-by-config. |
| Messaging | `kafka*`, `pulsar*`, `rabbitmq*` | 2–4g | same | 1024–2048 | Page cache + JVM. |
| Reverse proxies | `nginx*`, `traefik*`, `caddy*` | 512m | 512m | 1024 | Stateless. |
| Helix application | `helixagent*`, `helixllm*`, `helixqa*`, `helix*` | 3–4g | same | 2048 | Real workloads. |
| Build / CI | `*-builder*`, `*-ci-*`, `*-test*` | 3–4g | same | 2048–4096 | Compilers fork heavily. |
| **Default fallback** | (no match) | 2g | 2g | 1024 | Conservative. |

`oom_score_adj` is **always** `500` — see § 4.2.

### 4.2 Why `oom_score_adj = 500` everywhere

The user systemd manager (`user@1000.service`) is set to
`OOMScoreAdjust=-900` by the system-level hardening in this project (or
defaults to ~0 without it). We want every container in the user slice
to be a more attractive OOM target than that manager. Setting
`oom_score_adj = 500` produces an effective score of
`oom_score_base + 500` which is virtually guaranteed to be picked over
the user manager. Higher values (e.g. 1000) work too but can interact
poorly with services that *should* survive a pressure spike (Postgres);
500 is the smallest value that still reliably saves the user session.

### 4.3 Adding a new service

Two cases:

1. **The service name matches an existing pattern** — nothing to do.
   Run `Containers/scripts/resource-policy/apply_caps.py` and the four
   keys will be inserted at the top of the new service block.

2. **It needs a custom cap (heavier than its pattern allows)** — add a
   rule to *both* `policy.yaml` and `policy.go::Default()`. Keep the
   ordering: more-specific patterns above less-specific ones.

Then run the test suite (§ 5). If `test_caps.py` passes, you're done.

## 5. Tooling

```
Containers/
└── scripts/resource-policy/
    ├── policy.yaml          # YAML rules (single source of truth #1)
    ├── apply_caps.py        # bulk-applier (idempotent)
    ├── test_caps.py         # 20 tests covering matching, coverage,
    │                        #   placement, budget, and idempotency
    └── apply-report.md      # last run's summary
└── pkg/policy/
    ├── policy.go            # Go rules (single source of truth #2)
    └── policy_test.go       # 6 Go tests
```

### Run the bulk applier

```sh
cd HelixAgent
Containers/scripts/resource-policy/apply_caps.py [--dry-run]
```

It walks the project, skips third-party submodules, applies caps to
every user-owned compose file. Idempotent on repeat runs.

### Run the tests

```sh
cd HelixAgent
python3 Containers/scripts/resource-policy/test_caps.py
go test ./Containers/pkg/policy/...
```

### Use the Go policy at runtime

```go
import "digital.vasic.containers/pkg/policy"

p := policy.Default()
cap := p.CapFor(serviceName)            // returns Cap{Mem, Memswap, Pids, OOMAdj}
mem, swap, _ := cap.Bytes()             // raw bytes if you need them
if err := cap.Validate(); err != nil { ... }
```

`pkg/policy` is dependency-free; safe to vendor into other projects.

## 6. Skip-list — files we do NOT touch

`apply_caps.py` skips paths under any of:

* `/.git/`, `/node_modules/`, `/vendor/`
* `/.container-caps-backup-*` (its own backups)
* `/MCP/submodules/`, `/external/` (third-party MCP servers)
* `/cli_agents/{openhands,fauxpilot,gpt-engineer,claude-code-source,claude-plugins,postgres-mcp,kilo-code,roo-code,nanocoder,plandex,taskweaver,bridle,qwen-code,swe-agent}/`
* `/cli_agents/HelixCode/HelixCode/` (nested checkout)
* `/HelixQA/tools/opensource/` (third-party tools)
* `/mcp-servers/`, `/HelixCode/mcp-servers/`
* `/HelixLLM/docs/`, `/docs/research/`, `/docs/specs/`, `/docs/examples/`

Adding new third-party submodules? Extend `SKIP_PATH_FRAGMENTS` in
`apply_caps.py`. Never modify a compose file in code we don't own.

---

## 7. Budget math

Host: 62 GiB RAM, 16 GiB swap.
Reserved for kernel + GUI + AI agents: ~12 GiB.
Container budget: **50 GiB**.

`test_caps.py::TestTotalBudget::test_single_file_fits_budget` enforces
this for every non-profile compose file. Profile-heavy files
(`docker-compose.mcp-full.yml`, `docker-compose.protocols.yml`, etc.)
are exempt because the user only ever brings up a subset of services
via `--profile`. The `compose-up` wrapper adds a 16 GiB systemd scope
on top of any `podman compose up` invocation, so even an over-eager
profile selection cannot exceed that ceiling.

---

## 8. Tuning when you know better

Three escape hatches:

1. **Per-service override in the compose file.** Just write the four
   keys yourself. `apply_caps.py` will leave existing values alone
   unless run with `--force-rewrite`.

2. **Per-pattern override in `policy.yaml`.** Add a more-specific
   pattern higher up than the existing rule.

3. **Disable Layer 2 for a one-off invocation.** Run `podman compose
   up` directly instead of `compose-up`. Discouraged — preferred
   alternative is to raise the wrapper's `MemoryMax` for that session:
   `with-mem-cap -m 24G -- podman compose up …`.

---

## 9. Verifying enforcement at runtime

```sh
# Start any service:
cd HelixAgent && compose-up up -d postgres

# Inspect its cgroup:
podman inspect helixagent-postgres -f '{{.HostConfig.Memory}}'
# → 4294967296   (4 GiB)

# Or directly via cgroup v2:
cgpath=$(podman inspect helixagent-postgres -f '{{.State.CgroupPath}}')
cat /sys/fs/cgroup${cgpath}/memory.max
# → 4294967296
cat /sys/fs/cgroup${cgpath}/memory.swap.max
# → 4294967296
cat /sys/fs/cgroup${cgpath}/pids.max
# → 1024
```

If `memory.max` is `max` (i.e. unlimited) the cap was not propagated.
That has happened with podman-compose <1.0 and some old quadlet
generators; upgrade if you see it.

## 10. Change log

* **2026-04-25** — Policy created. 443/443 user-owned services capped
  across 35 compose files in the HelixAgent project. Go counterpart in
  `pkg/policy`. Comprehensive test suite (20 Python + 6 Go).
