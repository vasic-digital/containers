# Windows cross-build image provisioning

## What you are building

The `pkg/crossbuild` package needs a Linux container image with
Wine + JDK 17 + Gradle pre-installed. The image is the runtime that
executes the Yole Gradle build inside a Linux host targeting the
Windows `.msi` artifact via Wine's translation layer + the JDK's
`jpackage` tool.

Until this image exists on a given host, `pkg/crossbuild`'s
`WineContainerBackend.Build()` returns a clear actionable error
referencing both this document and the
`#crossbuild-windows-image-provisioning` skip-OK ticket so the
green-CI / red-Build distinction stays honest.

## Provisioning steps (Linux x86_64 host, rootless podman)

```bash
cd Submodules/containers/pkg/crossbuild

# 1. Build the image. ~2-5 minutes on a reasonable network.
podman build \
    -t ghcr.io/vasic-digital/crossbuild-wine:latest \
    -f windows_wine.Containerfile .

# 2. Smoke check Wine. Must print "wine-9.x" (or whichever Debian
#    package version this image base ships).
podman run --rm ghcr.io/vasic-digital/crossbuild-wine:latest wine --version

# 3. Smoke check Gradle. Must print "Gradle 8.11.1".
podman run --rm ghcr.io/vasic-digital/crossbuild-wine:latest gradle --version | head -10

# 4. (Optional) Push to the registry so other hosts can pull it
#    without rebuilding. Requires authenticated podman login first.
podman push ghcr.io/vasic-digital/crossbuild-wine:latest
```

## Verifying integration with `pkg/crossbuild`

```bash
cd Submodules/Containers
go test ./pkg/crossbuild/... -race -count=1
```

Expected: PASS. The integration tests use injected fakes for the
container runner so they pass even when the real image is not
provisioned. The real-stack Challenge (next section) is the one that
exercises the actual image.

## Real-stack Challenge

`challenges/crossbuild_windows_msi_challenge.sh` (Challenge script):

```bash
bash challenges/crossbuild_windows_msi_challenge.sh \
    --source-dir /path/to/Yole \
    --output-dir /path/to/Yole/releases
```

Expected on Linux x86_64 hosts WITH the image provisioned:

```
OK: produced Yole-Windows-x64-1.0.1-Release-0.0.0.1.1.msi (size N bytes)
PASS: crossbuild_windows_msi_challenge
```

Expected when the image is NOT yet provisioned:

```
SKIP-OK: #crossbuild-windows-image-provisioning — ghcr.io/vasic-digital/crossbuild-wine:latest not on host
```

Expected on darwin/aarch64 hosts (Wine-in-Docker not supported):

```
SKIP-OK: #env-darwin-no-wine-container — wine-container backend requires Linux host
```

A PASS without an actual non-zero `.msi` is a bluff under
CONST-035 § 11.4 + Lava Sixth Law 6.B. The Challenge enforces this
via `[[ -s "$OUTPUT_MSI" ]]` post-condition.

## When this approach hits its limits

Wine-in-Docker cross-builds the .msi reliably for plain Compose
Desktop applications. If a Yole release requires Windows-specific
behaviour Wine cannot translate (kernel-mode drivers, codec
licensing checks, signed-driver loaders), fall back to the
`QEMUWindowsBackend` (sibling Backend; uses pkg/vm/qemu.go to boot
a real Windows guest). That path is slower but supports the full
Windows API surface. Provisioning the QEMU disk image is documented
in `docs/crossbuild/qemu-windows-image-provisioning.md` (separate
file, owed for iter-55+ when the operator commissions it).
