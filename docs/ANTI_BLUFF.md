# Anti-Bluff Discipline (CONST-035) — Runbook

This document is the runbook for working with the anti-bluff gates in
this repository. The rule itself lives in `CONSTITUTION.md` (CONST-035).

## What "bluff" means here

A test is **bluff** if it can pass without exercising the user-visible
behavior it claims to verify. In this Go submodule, "user-visible"
means an operator invoking the CLI/binary can observe the result — the
anchor signal is a CLI invocation against a real target producing an
observable artifact (file on disk, exit code, log line) that the test
asserts on.

## Three gates

1. **Static scanner** (`scripts/anti-bluff/bluff-scanner.sh`) — pattern
   matcher that flags forbidden constructs. Runs on every commit
   (pre-commit hook) and in `make qa-all`.
2. **Mutation testing** (`go-mutesting`) — kills generated mutants.
   Threshold: 90% on changed code, 80% project-wide ratchet. Runs in
   `make qa-all` (slow; not in pre-commit).
3. **Behavior-anchor manifest** (`docs/behavior-anchors.md`) — every
   user-facing capability has at least one anchor test that proves it
   works end-to-end.

## "I got a bluff hit, what now?"

The scanner output names the file, line, BLUFF-G-NNN ID, and a
one-line context. Look up the BLUFF-G-NNN in the table below:

| ID | Pattern | Fix |
|----|---------|-----|
| BLUFF-G-001 | `t.Skip()` without exempt comment | Add `// SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` on the line above (or `// ANTI-BLUFF-EXEMPT: <ticket>` synonym), or remove the skip and fix the underlying issue. |
| BLUFF-G-002 | `if testing.Short()` early return without long-path coverage elsewhere | Add a sub-test that runs the long path; or add the exempt comment if short is correct here. |
| BLUFF-G-003 | Test body has only `t.Log`, no assertions | Add `t.Fatal`/`t.Error`/`testify` assertions. |
| BLUFF-G-004 | `gomock` mocking a type from the same package | Stop mocking the SUT; use the real type or move the mocked type to a different package. |
| BLUFF-G-005 | `t.Run("", func)` empty subtest body | Fill the subtest body with assertions or remove. |
| BLUFF-G-006 | Empty test function body | Fill or delete. |
| BLUFF-G-007 | `assert.True(t, true)` / `assert.NotNil(t, x)` as sole assertion | Add a real assertion that exercises the SUT's behavior. |

## Skip-exempt marker convention

The repository convention is `// SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` (the existing
project-wide marker). The scanner also recognizes the synonym
`// ANTI-BLUFF-EXEMPT: <ticket>` and, for mutation-equivalent
exemptions, `// ANTI-BLUFF-EXEMPT: TRIVIAL-CORRECT — <reason>`.
Place the marker on the line **above** the offending statement.

## "Mutation gate failed on my change"

`go-mutesting` printed mutants that survived (the test suite did not
detect them). Each surviving mutant is a place where the SUT's
behavior could change without any test noticing. Either:

- Add a test that would notice (preferred), or
- Add an in-line `// ANTI-BLUFF-EXEMPT: TRIVIAL-CORRECT — <reason>`
  if the mutant is genuinely equivalent (the mutated code is
  semantically identical to the original — extremely rare).

The challenge enforces 90% kill rate on changed files. Equivalent
mutants count toward the 10% slack; you should not need exemptions
unless your change happens to hit a mathematical identity.

## "Anchor manifest check failed"

`anchor_manifest_challenge.sh` validates `docs/behavior-anchors.md`.
Most failures are: the `anchor_test_path` you wrote does not resolve
to an existing test method. Re-check the path; the format is
`<relative path>.go::TestName` for Go.

## Reducing the baseline

The baseline file `challenges/baselines/bluff-baseline.txt` is
expected to shrink during sub-project 4. Removing a line is a
**ratchet improvement**: do it in the same commit that fixes the
underlying bluff. The scanner exits with code 2 if it sees a
baselined hit that is no longer present — this is the signal that the
baseline file is stale.

## Verification commands

Run all three before declaring work done:

```bash
bash scripts/anti-bluff/bluff-scanner.sh --mode all
bash challenges/scripts/anchor_manifest_challenge.sh
bash challenges/scripts/mutation_ratchet_challenge.sh
```

All three must pass.
